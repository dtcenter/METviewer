# METviewer
The METviewer tool reads MET verification statistics output from a database and creates plots using the R statistical package. The tool includes a web application that can be accessed from a web browser to create a single plot. The specification for each plot is built using a series of controls and then serialized into XML. For each plot, METviewer generates a SQL query, an R script to create the plot, a flat file containing the data that will be plotted and the plot itself.
