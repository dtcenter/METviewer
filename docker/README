#
# Note: Docker (https://www.docker.com) must be installed on your local machine.
# Recommend running "docker hello-world" to confirm that Docker is running well.
# You can run METviewer either by pulling a pre-built image from DockerHub or by
# building a METviewer image locally.
#

#
# Start by cloning the METviewer repository and entering the docker directory.
#
git clone https://github.com/dtcenter/METviewer
cd METviewer/docker

#
# Optionally, build a local METviewer image.
#
docker build -t metviewer .

#
# Define METVIEWER_IMAGE_NAME as the image to be run.
#
# If METviewer was built locally:
#
setenv METVIEWER_IMAGE_NAME metviewer # c-shell syntax
export METVIEWER_IMAGE_NAME=metviewer # bash syntax
#
# Or, pull from DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dtcenter/metviewer):
#
setenv METVIEWER_IMAGE_NAME dtcenter/metviewer # c-shell syntax
export METVIEWER_IMAGE_NAME=dtcenter/metviewer # bash syntax

#
# Define MYSQL_DIR as the local path for MySQL tables.
#
# Rather than writing MySQL tables inside the container, write them to your local machine.
# Create a MySQL directory and define it as an environment variable:
#
setenv MYSQL_DIR /path/for/mysql/tables # c-shell syntax
export MYSQL_DIR=/path/for/mysql/tables # bash syntax

#
# Define METVIEWER_DIR as the local path for METviewer output files.
#
# Rather than writing METviewer output inside the container, write it to your local machine.
# Create a METviewer directory and define it as an environment variable:
#
setenv METVIEWER_DIR /path/for/metviewer/output # c-shell syntax
export METVIEWER_DIR=/path/for/metviewer/output # bash syntax

#
# Define METVIEWER_DATA as the local path for METviewer input files.
#
# METviewer loads MET or VSDB data from this top-level directory on your machine.
#
setenv METVIEWER_DATA /path/for/data # c-shell syntax
export METVIEWER_DATA=/path/for/data # bash syntax

#
# From METviewer/docker, check your runtime environment and run "docker-compose up" to pull,
# if necessary, and start the containers.
#
./check_env.sh && docker-compose up -d

#
# To open a bash shell inside the running container.
#
docker exec -it metviewer_1 /bin/bash

#
# Inside the container:
#   /METviewer/bin contains all METviewer modules.
#   /data contains input MET and/or VSDB data.
#   MySQL database can be accessed by running:
#     mysql -h mysql_mv -uroot -pmvuser
#
# METviewer GUI is accessible via a web browser:
#   http://localhost:8080/metviewer/metviewer1.jsp
#

#
# From METviewer/docker, run "docker-compose down" to stop and remove the containers.
#
docker-compose down
