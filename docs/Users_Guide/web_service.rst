METviewer Web Service
*********************

The METviewer web service is a web-server driven API that parses XML
requests and returns results in an XML structure. All calls are
session-less meaning that each individual call does not affect and is
not affected by the results of any other call. Also, a client does not
have to establish a connection with the server and all calls can be
made automatically.

The web service can be accessed using the relative URL metviewer/servlet,
for example http://www.dtcenter.org/met/metviewer/servlet. When the web
service receives an HTTP GET request, it echoes the GET parameters and
acts as a "ping" mechanism to ensure that the system is online and
working. All API XML requests should be issued using an HTML POST
request with the XML request as the entire body. The XML response
will indicate the type of request, and echo some information.

There are several different request types, each with a particular format
of response. The METviewer client calls the different API methods in a
loose ordering:

#. List available databases
   
#. List forecast variables for user selected database

#. List stats for user selected database and forecast variable

#. List values for user selected fixed fields

#. Repeat steps 2-4 as needed
   
#. Plot request for user selected database and plot information

API Request/Response Formats
============================

The following sections each describe a web service API function in terms
of the request/response XML structure.

List Databases
--------------

List the METviewer databases that are available on the system for access
through the web app. The returned list reflects the contents of the
mvservlet.properties file in the web app installation folder.

Request:

.. code-block:: XML

        <request><list_db/></request>

Response:

.. code-block:: XML

        <list_db>
          <val>mv_gfs_nam</val>
          <val>mv_hmt_2010</val>
          <val>mv_hmt_2011</val>
          <val>mv_hwt_2010</val>
          <val>mv_met_ncep</val>
        </list_db>

List Values
-----------
          
The list_val request is used to conditionally list the distinct values in
the stat_header table of the selected database. The stat_field element
controls which field's values should be listed. There are two conditions
that can be optionally included in the request: a fcst_var/stat pair and
a stat_header field name with a set of values. At this point, it is worth
noting that although the fields fcst_lead, fcst_valid_beg and fcst_lead_beg
are not in the stat_header table of the database schema, they are
considered stat_header fields from the standpoint of the METviewer servlet
and client. The virtual fields inithour and validhour are considered
stat_header fields.

The id element is common to the list_val and list_stat API methods, and
the value specified in the request is simply echoed back to the client
in the response. This feature helps the client determine which controls
should be updated with the contents of the response.

**Request #1:** In this case, the request is for all distinct values
of the stat_header field fcst_var, without any conditions.

.. code-block:: XML
        
        <request>
          <db_con>mv_gfs_nam</db_con>
          <list_val>
            <id>0</id>
            <stat_field>FCST_VAR</stat_field>
          </list_val>
        </request>

**Response #1**

.. code-block:: XML

        <list_val>
          <id>0</id>
          <val>APCP_03</val>
          <val>APCP_24</val>
        </list_val>
                   

**Request #2:** This conditional request is for all distinct values of
vx_mask for which the fcst_var is APCP_03 and the statistic type is
categorical (the statistic CSI can be found in the database table
line_data_cts). An additional stat_header field condition stipulates
that only vx_mask values whose fcst_lead is 120000 should be returned.

.. code-block:: XML

        <request>
          <db_con>mv_gfs_nam</db_con>
          <list_val>
            <id>3</id>
            <stat_field>VX_MASK</stat_field>
            <stat>
              <fcst_var name="APCP_03">
                <val>CSI</val>
              </fcst_var>
            </stat>
            <field name="OBTYPE">
              <val>MC_PCP</val>
            </field>
          </list_val>
        </request>

**Response #2:** The response contains only values of vx_mask for which
the criteria are satisfied. This feature is useful to users for narrowing
the results of subsequent search requests. Note that, for performance
reasons, time criteria such as fcst_valid_beg, fcst_init_beg and
fcst_lead does not affect the results of non-time based fields and
vice versa.

.. code-block:: XML

        <list_val>
          <id>3</id>
          <val>FULL</val>
          <val>CONUS</val>
          <val>EAST</val>
        </list_val>

                  
List Statistics
---------------

The list_stat request builds a list of all statistics available in the
METviewer database for the specified fcst_var. It is primarily used to
construct the dep1 and dep2 portions of the plot request. Conditional
criteria is not supported in list_stat requests.

**Request**

.. code-block:: XML
        
        <request>
          <db_con>mv_gfs_nam</db_con>
          <list_stat>
            <id>0</id>
            <stat_fcst_var>APCP_03</stat_fcst_var>
          </list_stat>
        </request>

**Response (abridged)**

.. code-block:: XML

        <list_stat>
          <id>0</id>
          <val>ACC</val>
          <val>BASER</val>
          <val>CSI</val>
          <val>FAR</val>
          <val>GSS</val>
        </list_stat>


Generate Plot
-------------

Once a user has provided all the information for a complete plot
specification, the plot request handles the parsing of the plot
specification and generation of the plot. If a plot is successfully
created from the plot specification, the location of the plot image
is included in the response. If any error or warning information was
captured from R during the process, it will be included in the r_error
element.

**Request**

.. code-block:: XML
        
        <request>
          <db_con>mv_gfs_nam</db_con>
          <plot>??(see body of plot element) link to Chapter**
          </plot>
        </request>

**Response**

.. code-block:: XML
        
        <plot>plot_00155_20111019_122758</plot>
        <r_error>NAs produced by integer overflow</r_error>
