**Foreword: A note to METviewer users**

This user's guide is provided as an aid to users of the METviewer. METviewer
is a database and display system designed to work with the ASCII output
statistics produced by the MET software. MET is a set of verification tools
developed by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC) for use by the numerical
weather prediction community - and especially users and developers of the
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model - to help them assess and
evaluate the performance of numerical weather predictions.

It is important to note here that MET and METviewer are evolving software
packages. Previous releases of METviewer have occurred each year since 2010.
This documentation describes the |release| release dated |release_date|.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes.
