Reliability Plots

Description
===========

Reliability (or attributes) diagrams are used to show the conditional bias
of probabilistic forecasts. If a probability forecast is reliable, then
the relative frequency of events for a certain category of probability
forecasts will be approximately the same as the forecast probability.
In other words, when a 50% probability of precipitation is forecast,
approximately half of the corresponding observations should indicate
that precipitation fell. 

The reliability diagram groups the forecasts into bins according to the
issued probability (x axis). The frequency with which the event was
observed to occur for this sub-group of forecasts is then plotted against
the y axis. For perfect reliability the forecast probability and the
frequency of occurrence should be equal, and the plotted points should lie
on the diagonal (by default a solid grey line in the example figure below).
In other words, when a 50% probability of precipitation is forecast,
approximately half of the corresponding observations should indicate
that precipitation fell.

Reliability diagrams can be used to make adjustments to the conditional
bias of the forecast probabilities.

Line Type
=========

Reliability diagrams require the probability statistics (PCT line type)
generated by either Point-Stat or Grid-Stat.


How-To
======

Selection of options to produce the reliability diagram proceeds
approximately counter-clockwise around the METviewer window.

#. Select the desired database from the “Select databases” pulldown menu
   at the top margin of the METviewer window.
   
#. There are a number of tabs just under the database pulldown menu. Select
   the ‘Rely’ tab.

#. Select the desired series variable to calculate statistics for in the
   “Series Variables” tab. Press the “+ Series Variable” button to reveal
   two pulldown menus. The first pulldown menu in the lists the categories
   available in the selected dataset. The second pulldown menu allows the
   selection of the value of that category. The reliability diagram only
   makes sense for probability forecasts. These can be from ensemble
   forecasts or from a traditional forecast. 

#. It usually does not make sense to mix statistics for different groups.
   The desired group to calculate statistics over can be specified in the
   “Specialized Plot Fixed Values” section. For a reliability diagram,
   the forecast variable (“FCST_VAR”) must be selected. In the example
   below, the forecast variable is “APCP_24_ENS_FREQ_gt12.700”. A single
   domain (category: “VX_MASK”, value: “EAST”) is chosen. If multiple
   domains or thresholds were chosen, the statistics would be a summary
   of all of those cases together, which may not always be desired.

#. Choose whether or not to display the reliability event histogram in the
   "Reliability Event Histogram" section. Event histograms allow the user
   to see how often the forecast falls within each probability bin. The
   sample sizes in each bin are typically different, and some may be too
   small for conclusions. They also allow the user to judge the sharpness
   of the forecasts.

#. There are two checkboxes in the "Reliability Event Histogram" section. 
   
   * Skill line: The skill, or reliability, of a forecast is indicated by
     the proximity of the plotted curve to the diagonal skill line. The
     deviation from the diagonal gives the conditional bias. If the curve
     lies below the line, this indicates over-forecasting (probabilities
     too high); points above the line indicate under-forecasting
     (probabilities too low).
  
   * Reference line: This line (typically dashed) denotes the sample
     climatology or base rate, the frequency of the event.

#. Select what summary curve to display (if any) in the "Summary Curve"
   section.

#. Adjust the aggregation options, if desired, in the "Aggregation options"
   section.

#. Now enough information has been entered to produce a graph. To do this,
   click the “Generate Plot” button at the top of the METviewer window
   (this is in red text). Typically, if a plot is not produced, it is
   because the database selected does not contain the correct type of
   data. Also, it is imperative to check the data used for the plot by
   selecting the “R data” tab on the right hand side, above the plot area.
   The data from the database that is being used to calculate the
   statistics is listed in this tab. This tab should be checked to avoid
   the accidental accumulation of inappropriate database lines. For
   example, it does not make sense to accumulate statistics over different
   domains, thresholds, models, etc.

There are many other options for plots, but these are the basics.


Example
=======

The reliability diagram shown below is for the probability of 24 hour
precipitation with accumulations greater than or equal to 12.7 cm occurring
over the eastern CONUS. In the figure the reliability curve has a positive
slope, indicating that as the forecast probability of the event occurring
increases, so does the likelihood of observing the event. The forecasts
therefore have some reliability. However, the slope is much less than the
diagonal, indicating conditional bias or a lack of reliability. In this
example, when the forecast probability of precipitation is equal to 55%
the actual chance of observing the event is closer to 35%.

The histogram shows the relative frequency with which the event has been
predicted (typically over the reference period and at all grid points) with
different levels of probability. In the example, the majority of forecasts
predict low probabilities of precipitation (near the climatological
probability of ~5%). The forecast system is also capable of predicting
relatively high probabilities of the event (e.g. greater than 40%), but
such forecasts are less common.
