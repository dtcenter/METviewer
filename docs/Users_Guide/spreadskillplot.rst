Spread vs. Skill Plots
**********************

Description
===========

Spread vs. Skill plots are widely used to evaluate the quality of ensemble
forecasting systems. One goal of ensemble forecasting is to have the
ensemble members represent the range of possible outcomes, which suggests
that the ensemble spread should approximately equal the skill of the
ensemble mean (as measured by RMSE). Spread and skill will be plotted on
the y-axis, and the user may select the x axis variable. Underdispersed
ensembles lack spread and overdispersed ensembles have too much spread. 

Ensemble skill is a measure of ensemble accuracy. A perfect spread/skill
ratio is 1. 


How-To
======

Selection of options to produce the spread vs. skill plot  proceeds
approximately counter-clockwise around the METviewer window.

#. Select the desired database from the “Select databases” pulldown menu
   at the top margin of the METviewer window.

#. There are a number of tabs just under the database pulldown menu. Select
   the ‘Series’ tab, which is the leftmost tab.

#. Select the type of MET statistics that will be used to create the series
   plot. Click on the “Plot Data” pulldown menu which is located under the
   tabs. The list contains “Stat”, “MODE”, or “MODE-TD”. For details about
   these types of output statistics in MET, please see the most recent
   version of the
   `MET User's Guide <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/model-evaluation-tools-met/documentation>`_.

#. Select the desired variable to calculate statistics for in the “Y1 Axis
   Variables” tab. The first pulldown menu in the “Y1 Dependent (Forecast)
   Variables” section lists the variables available in the selected database.

#. Select the desired statistic to calculate in the second pulldown menu
   which is to the right of the variable menu. This lists the available
   attribute statistics in the selected dataset. Multiple statistics can be
   selected and they will each be plotted as a separate line on the plot.
   For a Spread/Skill plot, two statistics must be selected. In the example
   below the statistics are "SSVAR_RMSE" and "SSVAR_Spread". 

#. Select the Y1 Series Variable from the first pulldown menu in that
   section. There are many options. “MODEL” is used in the included example.
   In the second pulldown menu to the right of the first are the series
   variable options, for example, different models.

#. It usually does not make sense to mix statistics for different groups.
   The desired group to calculate statistics over can be specified using
   the “Fixed Values” section. In the example below, a single domain
   (category: “VX_MASK”, value: “EAST”) and level (category: "FCST_LEV",
   value: "Z2")  are chosen. If multiple domains or thresholds were chosen,
   the statistics would be a summary of all of those cases together, which
   may not always be desired.

#. Select the x-axis value in the “Independent Variable” dropdown menu.
   For a spread/skill plot, this is often a date, lead time, or threshold.
   For a spread/skill plot, this variable must be continuous and there
   should be reason to believe that the statistic on the Y1 axis is
   connected across the values of the independent variable. If not, a
   scatter plot would be a more appropriate choice than the series plot.
   In the example in the next section, the Y1 dependent variable “Frequency
   Bias” is plotted for each of the “Y1 Series Variable” ensemble members.

#. Select the type of statistics summary by selecting the “Aggregation
   Statistics” button in the “Statistics” section. Aggregated statistics
   must be selected for certain varieties of statistics. The selection can
   be made from the leftmost dropdown menu in the “Statistics” section.
   Select the "Spread/Skill Variance (SSVAR)" option in the dropdown menu.

#. Now enough information has been entered to produce a graph. To do this,
   click the “Generate Plot” button at the top of the METviewer window (this
   is in red text). Typically, if a plot is not produced, it is because the
   database selected does not contain the correct type of data. Also, it is
   imperative to check the data used for the plot by selecting the “R data”
   tab on the right hand side, above the plot area. The data from the
   database that is being used to calculate the statistics is listed in
   this tab. This tab should be checked to avoid the accidental
   accumulation of inappropriate database lines. For example, it does not
   make sense to accumulate statistics over different domains, thresholds,
   models, etc.

There are many other options for plots, but these are the basics.

Example
=======

This example shows the 2-m temperature RMSE and spread for a series of
forecast lead times for an ensemble. Plotted are the spread and the skill.
