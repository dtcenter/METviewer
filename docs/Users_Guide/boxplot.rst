Box Plots

Description
===========

Box plots, or box and whisker plots, are a way to summarize a distribution
of values using Tukey's 5-number summary
(:ref:`Hoaglin et al., 1983<Hoaglin>`). The dark
line in the middle of the boxes (sometimes called the 'waist') is the
median of data. Half of the data values have a value greater than the
median, and half have a value lower. The actual box (i.e. the central
rectangle) spans the first quartile to the third quartile (or the
interquartile range or IQR). Whiskers extend to 1.5 times the height
of the box or, if closer to the median, the minimum or maximum values
of the data. The points represent outliers: any data point more than
1.5 times the IQR away from the median. These are defined as values
that do not fall inside the whiskers. Outliers are extreme values.

Box plots work best for comparing a set of continuous values (e.g. some
verification statistic) conditionally for a set of discrete categories.
The example below shows RMSE (root-mean-squared-error; a continuous
measure of forecast quality) for each of several distinct lead times.
Other examples could be probability of detection (POD) or Gilbert Skill
Score (GSS) across a set of models for a specific precipitation
threshold. Here, each forecast and observation is binary, but the
verification statistic is continuous. 

How-To
======

Selection of options to produce the plot proceeds approximately
counter-clockwise around the METviewer window. The steps to create a
series plot are:

#. Select the desired database from the “Select databases” pulldown menu
   at the top margin of the METviewer window.

#. There are a number of tabs just under the database pulldown menu.
   Select the ‘Box’ tab.

#. Select the type of MET statistics that will be used to create the
   box plot. Click on the “Plot Data” pulldown menu which is located
   under the tabs. The list contains “Stat”, “MODE”, or “MODE-TD”.
   For details about these types of output statistics in MET, please
   see the most recent version of the
   `MET User's Guide <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/model-evaluation-tools-met/documentation>`_.

#. Select the desired variable to calculate statistics for in the
   “Y1 Axis Variables” tab. The first pulldown menu in the “Y1 Dependent
   (Forecast) Variables” section lists the variables available in
   the selected dataset.

#. Select the desired statistic to calculate in the second pulldown
   menu which is to the right of the variable menu. This lists the
   available attribute statistics for the selected dataset. Multiple
   statistics can be selected and they will each be plotted as
   separate boxes on the plot.

#. Select the Y1 Series Variable from the first pulldown menu in that
   section. There are many options. “MODEL” is used in the included
   example. In the second pulldown menu to the right of the first are
   the series variable options, for example, different models.

#. It usually does not make sense to mix statistics for different
   groups. The desired group to calculate statistics over can be
   specified using the “Fixed Values” section. In the example below,
   a single domain (category: "VX_MASK", value: "CONUS") and a single
   level (category: "FCST_LEV", value: "Z2") are chosen. If multiple
   domains or thresholds were chosen, the statistics would be a
   summary of all of those cases together, which may not always be desired.

#. Select the x-axis value in the “Independent Variable” dropdown menu.
   For a box plot, this is often a date, lead time, or threshold. In the
   example in the next section, the Y1 dependent variable “RMSE” is
   plotted for the ensemble member selected in “Y1 Series Variable”
   and is plotted over forecast lead time.

#. Select the type of statistics summary by selecting either “Summary”
   or “Aggregation Statistics” button in the “Statistics” section.
   Aggregated statistics may be selected for certain varieties of
   statistics. The selection can be made from the leftmost dropdown
   menu in the “Statistics” section. By default, the median value of
   all statistics will be plotted. Using the dropdown menu, the mean
   or sum may be selected instead. Choosing this option will cause a
   single statistic to be calculated from the individual database lines.

#. There is a "Plot Configurations" that has options specific to box
   plots, including whether or not to show outliers, points, notches,
   and more. The box width can also be altered here. 
    
#. Now enough information has been entered to produce a graph. To do
   this, click the “Generate Plot” button at the top of the METviewer
   window (this is in red text). Typically, if a plot is not produced,
   it is because the database selected does not contain the correct
   type of data. Also, it is imperative to check the data used for the
   plot by selecting the “R data” tab on the right hand side, above
   the plot area. The data from the database that is being used to
   calculate the statistics is listed in this tab. This tab should be
   checked to avoid the accidental accumulation of inappropriate
   database lines. For example, it does not make sense to accumulate
   statistics over different domains, thresholds, models, etc.

There are many other options for plots, but these are the basics.


Example
=======

The example below shows a boxplot of the RMSE for 2m temperature over
the CONUS. Many of the standard METviewer plotting options are available
for the boxplot.

Here is the associated xml for this example. It can be copied into an
empty file and saved to the desktop then uploaded into the system by
clicking on the "Load XML" button in the upper-right corner of the GUI.
