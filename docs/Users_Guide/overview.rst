Overview of METviewer
=====================


Purpose and organization of the User's Guide
--------------------------------------------

The goal of this User's Guide is to provide basic information for users of
the METviewer database and display system to enable users to create plots
from their MET output statistics. 

The METviewer User's Guide is organized as follows.


The Developmental Testbed Center (DTC)
--------------------------------------

METviewer has been developed, and will be maintained and enhanced, by the
Developmental Testbed Center (`DTC <http://www.dtcenter.org/>`_ ). The main
goal of the DTC is to serve as a bridge between operations and research, to
facilitate the activities of these two important components of the numerical
weather prediction (NWP) community. The DTC provides an environment that is
functionally equivalent to the operational environment in which the research
community can test model enhancements; the operational community benefits
from DTC testing and evaluation of models before new models are implemented
operationally. METviewer serves both the research and operational
communities in this way - offering capabilities for researchers to test
their own enhancements to models and providing a capability for the DTC to
evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of advances in NWP prior to operational
implementation.

The METviewer package will also be available to DTC visitors and to the
modeling community for testing and evaluation of new model capabilities,
applications in new environments, and so on.


METviewer goals and design philosophy
-------------------------------------

The METviewer tool reads MET verification statistics output from a database
and creates plots using the R statistical package. The tool includes a web
application that can be accessed from a web browser to create a single plot.
The specification for each plot is built using a series of controls which
are then serialized into XML. The controls are found in the left half, lower
panel, and lower right quadrant of the METviewer browser. Details about these
controls are found in :ref:`userspec`. For each plot, METviewer generates
output in the form of a SQL query, an R script to create the plot, a flat
file containing the data that will be plotted and the plot itself. This
output populates the upper right quadrant of the METviewer database. 

The METviewer code and documentation is maintained by the DTC in Boulder,
Colorado. The MET package is freely available to the modeling, verification,
and operational communities, including universities, governments, the
private sector, and operational modeling and prediction centers.


METviewer Requirements
----------------------

METviewer requires installation of Java, Apache / Tomcat, MySQL, and R
statistics.

METviewer User Specifications
-----------------------------

The top menu allows the user to select a database and type for the plot. 

The first section is where the dependable variable (Y-axis) , statistic of
interest, and series variables of interest are selected. The Y2 axis can be
used to plot a Base Rate.

The fixed variables section controls the constraints for the plot (what
period of data is used, what thresholds to include, interpolation method, as
well as domains). Fixed values are for stratifications. For example, select
one or more thresholds to be aggregated, or one or more initialization
times, or a date range based on valid times or cycle time.

Each of the above selections can have one or multiple items. To add
variables, series, or fixed values, select the button with the '+' directly
below the desired item. Then additional selections will appear in a new
dropdown menu. To delete these extras, select the trash icon to the left of
the item. 

The independent variable section is where the X-axis is configured. As an
example, forecast lead hour often serves as the x-axis for a series plot.

This section is reserved for line labels and formatting for the individual
series confidence intervals: Normal Bootstrap Standard error (median or
mean) – configurable. 

Summary – scores computed per each combination of fixed values and
independent variable then mean or median taken. 

Aggregate statistics – accumulates SL1L2 lines or CTC counts prior to
calculating the statistics.

Confidence intervals - METviewer supports two statistical derivation
methods... (1) plot the mean of the daily stats with confidence intervals
defined by the "standard error"... that uses the standard deviation to add
confidence intervals and assumes normality (2) plot the aggregated
statistics with confidence intervals defined by bootstrapping that aggregation.

Pairwise Differencing – computes the difference in statistics for two models
on a pairwise basis (same forecast hour, same initialization, same region,
etc…).  Confidence intervals may be applied to determine statistical
significance.

Event Equalization – performs the filtering on two datasets to produce a
“homogeneous” intersection between the samples (same forecast hour, same
initialization, same region, etc…).  Use of this method is recommended when
trying to compare the skill of one or more predictions.


METviewer Output
----------------

METviewer output all appears in the tabbed boxes at the top right quadrant
of the web browser. The plot will show by default, but the user can click any
of the tabs along the top to see the other windows. The tabs include:

XML - This window contains all the code to reproduce the plot. It is
recommended that the user save it. It can be reloaded using the 'Load XML'
button at the top right of the METviewer web page.

Log - Contains some runtime information regarding input data, run time, and
which scripts were called.

R script - Contains the R code used to organize the data and create the plot.
This can be easily modified directly by the user to create slightly different
plots for alternate purposes.

R data - It is essential that all users look at the contents of this tab.
The data contained under the R data tab is the data used to create the plot.
Users should check to see if it is correct.
Often, a user with limited knowledge of the database
may select data in such a way as to combine information in an unintended way.
For example, statistics for different event thresholds should not be
combined, but if the user fails to select the threshold(s) correctly in the
'fixed values' section of METviewer, the plot will show statistics for the
combined data. 

SQL - This tab contains the SQL code used to gather the data for the plot.

Y1 Points - This tab will be blank for several of the plot types. 

Y2 Points - See above.

The rightmost tab is a small square. Clicking here will save the contents of
the current window to the default (usually 'Downloads') folder. It is
recommended that the user click through at least the plot and xml windows
and save this output.

METviewer Plot Formatting Specifications
----------------------------------------

METviewer plot formatting options appear in the tabbed boxes at the bottom
right quadrant of the web browser. The “Titles & Labels” tab will show by
default, but the user can click any of the tabs along the top to see the
other windows. The tabs include:

Titles and Labels: This menu contains boxes for the user to specify a plot
title, caption, and axis labels.

Common: This tab contains multiple check boxes and a confidence level
specification box. The check boxes add X2 axes, stagger points from different
axes, print points.

Formatting: Plot, title and grid formatting options are available here.
Options include image type, height, width, and resolution. Margins, offsets,
text size, line widths, etc. can all be set in units of text point size
(e.g. 8 = 8 pt font)

X1, X2, Y1, and Y2 - These tabs specify the axis labels and values. The text
size, weight, alignment and offset can be chosen. For Y1 and Y2 axes, limits
and buffers can also be set. 

Legend & Caption: Options for the Legend and Caption include text size,
position, alignment, color, offset. For details about setting these
specifications, see the R-help pages for the functions “legend” and / or
“title”. 

Reset: This button, shown to the far right with a circular arrow icon, will
reset all options to the defaults.


METviewer Series Formatting Specifications
------------------------------------------

At the bottom of the METviewer window is the series formatting box. It allows
the user to control the minute details of each line on a plot, including
title, color, symbol, line type, line width, legend text.

Four radio buttons along the bottom of this menu allow users to create a
derived curve or remove one, apply default values or lock the formatting in
place (so subsequent plots are identical in format). 


METviewer History Menu
----------------------

Along the left of the METviewer GUI, hidden by default, is the history menu.
To open this menu, click the arrow at the top left side right underneath
the “METviewer” label. This menu provides a list of all (or all successful)
recent plotting attempts using the METviewer GUI. Users can select items
from this menu to recover plots they may have neglected to save. Clicking
on the button showing loads the plot.


Future development plans
------------------------

METviewer is an evolving verification database and display software package.
New capabilities are planned in controlled, successive version releases. Bug
fixes and user-identified problems will be addressed as they are found. Plans
are also in place to incorporate many new capabilities and options in future
releases of METviewer. Additionally, updates to accommodate new features of
the MET software are often required.
