Contour Plots
*************

Description
===========

Contour plots are a very general plot type somewhat similar to a scatter
plot. The axes are specified by the user, and any will do so long as the
entire set of x and y locations has some value (i.e. not missing data). The
value is then contoured. This type of plot is often used to examine
statistics over a series of time or heights. Often, it can be desirable to
examine the difference in statistics between two NWP models as a contour
plot, as is shown in the example below. 

How-To
======

Selection of options to produce the plot proceeds approximately
counter-clockwise around the METviewer window. The steps to create a contour
plot are:

#. Select the desired database from the “Select databases” pulldown menu at
   the top margin of the METviewer window.

#. There are a number of tabs just under the database pulldown menu. Select
   the ‘Contour’ tab, which is the rightmost tab.

#. Select the desired variable to calculate statistics for in the “Variable
   and Statistic” tab. The first pulldown menu lists the variables
   available in the selected database.

#. Select the desired statistic to calculate in the second pulldown menu
   which is to the right of the variable menu. This lists the available
   attribute statistics in the selected dataset.

#. Select the Y axis Independent Variable from the first pulldown menu in
   the section of the same name. There are many options. “FCST_LEV” is used
   in the included example. In the second pulldown menu to the right of the
   first are the independent variable options.

#. It usually does not make sense to mix statistics for different groups.
   The desired group to calculate statistics over can be specified using
   the “Fixed Values” section. In the example below, a single domain
   (category: “VX_MASK”, value: “CONUS”) and a model (category: “MODEL”,
   value: “HRRR_hrconus”) are chosen. If multiple domains or thresholds
   were chosen, the statistics would be a summary of all of those cases
   together, which may not always be desired.

#. Select the x-axis value in the “X axis Independent Variable” section.
   For this example, it is the forecast initialization beginning time.

#. The "Configurations" section contains various options for the contour
   plot including the color scheme and contour line overlay. 

#. Select the type of statistics summary by selecting either “Summary” or
   “Aggregation Statistics” button in the “Statistics” section. Aggregated
   statistics may be selected for certain varieties of statistics. The
   selection can be made from the leftmost dropdown menu in the “Statistics”
   section. By default, the median value of all statistics will be plotted.
   Using the dropdown menu, the mean or sum may be selected instead.
   Choosing this option will cause a single statistic to be calculated
   from the individual database lines. 

#. Now enough information has been entered to produce a graph. To do this,
   click the “Generate Plot” button at the top of the METviewer window
   (this is in red text). Typically, if a plot is not produced, it is
   because the database selected does not contain the correct type of data.
   Also, it is imperative to check the data used for the plot by selecting
   the “R data” tab on the right hand side, above the plot area. The data
   from the database that is being used to calculate the statistics is
   listed in this tab. This tab should be checked to avoid the accidental
   accumulation of inappropriate database lines. For example, it does not
   make sense to accumulate statistics over different domains, thresholds,
   models, etc.

There are many other options for plots, but these are the basics.

Example
=======

The example is a contour plot of temperature mean error (bias) for one
model at different pressure levels over a range of initialization times.

Here is the associated xml for this example. It can be copied into an
empty file and saved to the desktop then uploaded into the system by
clicking on the "Load XML" button in the upper-right corner of the GUI.
