Bar Plots

Description
===========

A bar plot shows comparisons among discrete categories. One axis of the
chart shows the specific categories being compared, while the other
represents some measured value. The heights or lengths are proportional to
the values that they represent. Bar plots are simple and flexible, unlike
some other METview plot types. Rather than using prescribed statistics in
a specific way, the user can select both axes.

Bar plots are distinct from histograms and the two are not interchangeable.
Histograms show the frequency of occurrence of values in discrete
categories (that are sometimes created by binning continuous values).
To create a histogram, the user may only select the variable for a single
axis. In a bar plot, two axis values are selected by the user, one
categorical and one numeric.

Bar plots often represent counts or frequencies, however, bar plots can
represent means, medians, standard deviations, or any other statistic.

How-To
======

Selection of options to produce the plot proceeds approximately
counter-clockwise around the METviewer window. The steps to create a series
plot are:

#. Select the desired database from the "Select databases" pulldown menu
   at the top margin of the METviewer window.
   
#. There are a number of tabs just under the database pulldown menu. Select
   the 'Bar' tab.

#. Select the type of MET statistics that will be used to create the bar
   plot. Click on the “Plot Data” pulldown menu which is located under the
   tabs. The list contains “Stat”, “MODE”, or “MODE-TD”. For details about
   these types of output statistics in MET, please see the most recent
   version of the
   `MET User's Guide <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/model-evaluation-tools-met/documentation>`_.

#. Select the desired variable to calculate statistics for in the
   "Y1 Axis Variables" tab. The first pulldown menu in the  "Y1 Dependent
   (Forecast) Variables" section lists the variables available in the
   selected dataset.

#. Select the desired statistic to calculate in the second pulldown menu
   which is to the right of the variable menu. This lists the available
   attribute statistics for the selected dataset. Multiple statistics can
   be selected and they will each be plotted as a separate bar on the plot.

#. Select the Y1 Series Variable from the first pulldown menu in that
   section. There are many options. "MODEL" is used in the included
   example. In the second pulldown menu to the right of the first are the
   series variable options, for example, different models.

#. It usually does not make sense to mix statistics for different groups.
   The desired group to calculate statistics over can be specified using
   the "Fixed Values" section. In the example below, a precipitation
   threshold value (category: "FCST_THR", value: ">=2.54") is chosen. If
   multiple domains or thresholds were chosen, the statistics would be a
   summary of all of those cases together, which may not always be desired.

#. Select the x-axis value in the "Independent Variable" dropdown menu. For
   a bar plot, this is often a date, lead time, or threshold. In the
   example in the next section, the Y1 dependent variable “Object Count”
   is plotted for two of the “Y1 Series Variable” ensemble members.
   
#. Select the type of statistics summary by selecting either "Summary" or
   "Aggregation Statistics" button in the “Statistics” section. Aggregated
   statistics may be selected for certain varieties of statistics. The
   selection can be made from the leftmost dropdown menu in the
   "Statistics" section. By default, the median value of all statistics
   will be plotted. Using the dropdown menu, the mean or sum may be
   selected instead. Choosing this option will cause a single statistic
   to be calculated from the individual database lines. 

#. Now enough information has been entered to produce a graph. To do this,
   click the "Generate Plot" button at the top of the METviewer window
   (this is in red text). Typically, if a plot is not produced, it is
   because the database selected does not contain the correct type of data.
   Also, it is imperative to check the data used for the plot by selecting
   the "R data" tab on the right hand side, above the plot area. The data
   from the database that is being used to calculate the statistics is
   listed in this tab. This tab should be checked to avoid the accidental
   accumulation of inappropriate database lines. For example, it does not
   make sense to accumulate statistics over different domains, thresholds,
   models, etc.

There are many other options for plots, but these are the basics.

Example
=======

The image below shows an example of the plot and set-up options for a
series plot in METviewer. This example uses the database
“mv_hrrr_sppmp_test” to plot “MODE” output for seven ensemble members.
The total object count over the is plotted for 3-hour precipitation
accumulation exceeding >=2.54 cm. Appropriate titles and labels have been
entered in the titles and labels tab shown below the plot. Colors and line
formatting are shown across the bottom menu of the plot. The values here
are the defaults.
