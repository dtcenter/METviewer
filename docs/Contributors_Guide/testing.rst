Testing Example - Install and Run on dakota
===========================================

**Testing directory and branch information**

| Testing HOME directory: */d3/projects/METViewer/auto_test*
| Testing data directory: */d3/projects/METViewer/test_data/load_data/load*
| Branch to verify against: mv_2_5_dev
| Branch to verify : mv_2_6
| 

**Steps**

#. Check out and copy to the HOME script : **auto_test.sh**
   
#. Create a database for the branch to verify against (mv_2_5_dev):

   .. code-block:: none
   
        mysql -uUSER -p -e 'create database mv_test_mv_2_5_dev'

#. Clone and build the branch to verify against (mv_2_5_dev):

   .. code-block:: none
   
        ./auto_test.sh -UGIT_USER -t/d3/projects/METViewer/auto_test/METViewerTest -bmv_2_5_dev -Bmv_2_5_dev -l/d3/projects/METViewer/test_data/load_data/load -dmv_test_2_5_dev -uUSER -m/d3/projects/METViewer/auto_test/METViewer -pUSER -hHOST -P3306

#. Create a database for the branch to verify (mv_2_6):

   .. code-block:: none
   
        mysql -uUSER -p -e 'create database mv_test_mv_2_6'

#. Clone, build and verify the branch:

   .. code-block:: none
   
        ./auto_test.sh -UGIT_USER -t/d3/projects/METViewer/auto_test/METViewerTest -bmv_2_6 -Bmv_2_5_dev -l/d3/projects/METViewer/test_data/load_data/load -dmv_test_2_6 -uUSER -m/d3/projects/METViewer/auto_test/METViewer -pUSER -hHOST -P3306

If the testing is done using crontab the git user credentials should be
stored in the
`git store <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage>`_ .
Also, **auto_test.sh** should be modified to send emails with testing results.

Testing - Capture
=================

The testing module is used to execute the regression testing of a specified
version of METviewer. The capture tool is invoked by using the mv_test.sh
script. During test capture, system or processing errors will be reported
but images and data are not verified. Verification of data or images is
performed by the mv_compare.sh script. The mv_test.sh script essentially
generates output files and copies them from the output directory to the
appropriate directory test_cases directory.

Capture and Verification are performed against a specified METviewer branch
and tag. It is expected that the proper branch or tag has been previously
fetched or cloned and checked out into the METviewer home directory that is
specified with -m (the auto test script does check out specific code and
then runs test capture and compare - see below). The METviewer test
directory should also be a subdirectory that corresponds to the proper
branch and tag, with an output directory that will contain the generated
images, scripts and data for a given test run, along with the corresponding
test_data (use case xml files) and load data (load specification xml
files). The actual load data files are not yet source controlled and so they
are linked from the path to the met data that is specified with the -l
option. The auto_test.sh script takes branch and tag parameters and creates
the proper test subdirectory and reconciles properly with the remote
repository. All the mv_test.sh script needs is the proper test subdirectory.
Successfully generated output images will be copied to the appropriate
test_cases directory.

**NOTE ABOUT GIT TAGS**

A short discussion of METviewer git tags is appropriate here. Git tags are not
directly related to any git branches. They are different things. A git tag
simply refers to a specific commit to the git repository. The branches that
existed at the time of the tagging could all be deleted (except for the master)
and the tag would still be a valid tag. In METviewer, tags are named after the
branches, i.e. MV_2_6_<tag_name>. This creates a mnemonic relationship to a
branch. Furthermore, only create tags after a commit to a specific branch that
is then referenced in the tag name. That tagged commit is a special point in
the history of the repository, a point to be captured for a given branch. By
specifying the tag and branch, the repository pointer is set to a specific
commit for a given branch.  Including a branch name is only a mnemonic that
serves as a reminder of the branch the tag was set on behalf of. The mnemonic
allows organization of the tests for regression checking against special times
in the repository commit history.


**NOTE** To do binary comparisons on captured test data,
the test data is saved in a directory structure that is mnemonically tied
to the product branches or tags. The METviewer code under test is only ever
checked out to one specific branch HEAD, or to a tag point, at a time. Its
produced data and images may be compared, however, to data that was
captured by a different version or tag point of METviewer code. This test
directory structure might look like this, for example...

Testing - Verify
================

The mv_compare.sh script accepts a branch and a tag that it uses to identify a test subdirectory and a second "expected" branch and tag that it uses to identify a comparison test directory. If tags are omitted the HEAD is used. The compare script looks for corresponding image files in the corresponding plots directories and does a binary comparison of the corresponding files. Differences will be reported as errors.

Auto Test
=========

The auto_test.sh script defines the branch, optionally a tag, directories, and database credentials for a version under test and a comparison version. It performs the following steps.

#. Remove any *METviewer* directory and *METviewerTestSource* directory.

#. Do a git clone into the *METviewer* home directory and checkout the corresponding branch or tag.
                                                                     
#. Do a git clone of the METviewer testing repository into the *METviewerTestSource* directory (this is not the test directory).          

#. If needed create a *METVIEWER_TEST_DIR* subdirectory for the specified branch and load common data from the *METviewerTestSource* into it.

#. Run the testing capture program to capture test data for the specified branch, and copy the data to the corresponding test subdirectory.

#. Run the testing verify program to verify the images in the two corresponding test subdirectories.

The testing and comparison modules produce output files (images, points,
XML, data) and compare them with the expected output. In order for tests
to pass, produced and expected files should be byte identical.
                        
NOTE: R scripts create visually similar results but bitwise different
image files on different platforms.

Testing Submodules
==================
               
**LoadDataTest** recreates and refills the mv_test database with MET output
data and compares the number of rows in each table with the expected number.
Test data and XML configuration file are located in the *<test_dir>/load_data*
directory.

**CreatePlotBatchTest** runs MVBatch with testing plot specification files
and creates output files with the expected output. Any errors encountered
with creating plots will be reported. Images are not compared
Plot specification files and expected output are located in the
*<test_dir>/plots_batch/<test_type>* directory.

**ComparePlotBatchTest** compares a test ROOT_DIR with a test COMPARE+DIR.
These directories are specified by the testdir and compare dir.
plot specification files and expected output are located in the
*<test_dir>/test_data_test_cases/<test_type>* directories.

**TestMVServlet** simulates POST intermediate requests (ex. get a list of
variables), send them to MVServlet and compare the servlet's response
with the expected output. Requests files and expected response are located
in the *<test_dir>/servlet/* directory.

**CreatePlotServletTest** simulates POST, creates plot requests, sends
them to MVServlet and compares produced output files with the expected output.
Requests files and expected output files are located in the
*<test_dir>/plots_web/<test_type>* directory.

Location of *<test_dir>* : */d3/projects/METViewer/test_data/*
